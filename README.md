The first task is to connect five servo motors to Arduino and then control these motors to move from 0 to 90 degrees and then turn back to 0 degree. Each servo motor has three terminals: power, ground and signal. Each signal wire is connected to a digital pin on the Ardunio as shown in the circuit diagram. 
"for loop" is used to do the mentioned task, starting from 0 to 90 and then go back to the initial point 0.

The second task is to use potentiometers to control the movement of the servo motors. Each servo motor has also three terminals: power, ground and signal. And each signal wire was connected to an analog pin on the Arduino. The variable value is taken from the potentiometer and is sent to the motor to move accordingly.
